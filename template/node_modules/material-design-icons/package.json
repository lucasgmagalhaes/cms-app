  "readme": "# Material design icons\n\nMaterial design icons are the official [icon set](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons) from Google that are designed under the [material design guidelines](http://www.google.com/design/spec).\n\n### 3.0.1 Update\n\n* Changed license in package.json.\n* Added missing device symbol sprites.\n\n### 3.0.0 Update\n\nLicense change to Apache 2.0!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nRead the [developer guide](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) on how to use the material design icons in your project.\n\n### Using a font collection\n\nThe `iconfont` folder contains pre-generated font files that can be included in a project. This is especially convenient for the web; however, it is generally better to link to the web font hosted on Google Fonts:\n\n```html\n<link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons\"\n      rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\nRead more in the [font portion](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web) of our full developer guide.\n\n### Using symbols and sprites\n\nThe `css-sprite` and `svg-sprite` folders contain pre-generated sprite sheets, as well as svg symbols that can be `<use>`d more directly and with fewer constraints. Instructions for using them are in the [sprites documentation](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/sprites).\n\n## Polymer icons\n\nIf you wish to use the icon set with Polymer, we recommend consuming them via the [`<iron-icons>`](https://github.com/polymerelements/iron-icons) element ([`<core-icons>`](https://github.com/Polymer/core-icons) in v0.5).\n\n## License\n\nWe have made these icons available for you to incorporate them into your products under the [Apache License Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt). Feel free to remix and re-share these icons and documentation in your products.\nWe'd love attribution in your app's *about* screen, but it's not required. The only thing we ask is that you not re-sell these icons.\n",
